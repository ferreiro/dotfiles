#<a name="welcome"></a>Welcome to JF~Dotfiles!
<img src="api/assets/mac.png" />

Hi! Welcome to JF~Dotfiles repository. I spent the last two days and half crafting and learning how to make my own Dotfiles. I'm really proud of the result and can't wait to improve them and make more cool features in the following months. If you have some ideas, I'll be happy to open this repository to contributions (read ['how to make suggestions'](#contribute) below).

### What is a Dotfile?

According to [Drew Barontini](http://drewbarontini.com/setup/dotfiles/):
"Dotfiles is a name used to denote a set of configuration files (generally hidden ones with a `.` before the filename) that are used to set up and configure various applications and settings, such as: Bash. Git. Vim. Sublime Text"

### How to automatically install the Dotfiles?

There are two options:

- The first is cloning the repository into your computer and then execute
`install.sh` script.

- `Coming soon` One line Installation


### Goals with this repository

1. Crafting a program to install easily and comfortably all my mac applications, configuration files and design preferences (Dock, Finder...).
2. Analyzing why Dotfiles are so useful and learn how to make them properly.
3. Making the program easy to understand and open to modification (Choosing a good structure for future improvements, modifications and community improvements).

#<a name="newbie"/> New to Dotfiles? Don't be panic!

I know that feeling. You are starting to see all that strange bash scripts and you don't know what's going on. Don't be panic, all of us had felt something like this at certain point ;). I recommend you start by reading these articles (they helped me a lot):

- [Getting Started With Dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789) is an awesome Medium Post that I strongly recommend you to understand how Dotfiles are structured and how do they work. I followed this post to create this repository.
- [Unofficial Guide to Dotfiles on Github](https://dotfiles.github.io) is a great online guide with a bunch of useful links and tips to get started or make your Dotfiles even better.
- [Popular repositories by JF](https://github.com/Ferreiros-lab/popular-dotfiles.git) is a list of useful Dotfiles Repositories I created to get Ideas from.
- [Vítor’s dotfiles](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/dotfiles)  is a good example of how to modularize dotfiles.

#<a name="thanks"/> Special thanks

I want to give special thanks to some amazing developers who shared publicly their Dotfiles, letting the community to learn from their work.

Thanks to them I've learned to make my Dotfiles even better. I strongly recommend you to check their repositories, you'll learn a lot.

**@webpro**. Webpro is the guy who made the 'Getting Starting With Dofiles' article that I recommend you to read in the [New to Dotfiles](#newbie) section. I started my Dotfiles following his structure. [Webpro Dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles) are well organised and contains cool (like running only specific parts of your Dotfiles instead the whole program from terminal).

**@mathiasbynens**. Mathias created one of the most awesome Mac "defaults" scripts out there. His [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) contains also useful scripts. Check them out!

Also I included the auto download feature using curl from this [repo](https://github.com/blorente/dotfiles).
